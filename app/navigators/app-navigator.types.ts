/**
 * This type allows TypeScript to know what routes are defined in this navigator
 * as well as what properties (if any) they might take when navigating to them.
 *
 * If no params are allowed, pass through `undefined`. Generally speaking, we
 * recommend using your MobX-State-Tree store(s) to keep application state
 * rather than passing state through navigation params.
 *
 * For more information, see this documentation:
 *   https://reactnavigation.org/docs/params/
 *   https://reactnavigation.org/docs/typescript#type-checking-the-navigator
